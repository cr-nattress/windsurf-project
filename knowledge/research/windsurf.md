Core Features Overview
Cascade AI Assistant
Cascade is Windsurf's flagship AI feature that combines deep codebase understanding with advanced tools for seamless collaboration.

Key Capabilities:

Full contextual awareness across your entire codebase

Multi-file editing with synchronized changes

Real-time awareness of your actions and project state

Tool integration including search, analyze, web search, MCP, and terminal

Operating Modes:

Write Mode: Allows Cascade to create and modify your codebase directly

Chat Mode: Optimized for questions about your codebase or general coding principles

Windsurf Tab (Autocomplete)
Windsurf Tab has evolved into a contextually aware diff-suggestion and navigation engine powered by SWE-1-mini.

Features:

Autocomplete: Generative code suggestions based on context

Supercomplete: Advanced predictions beyond cursor position

Tab to Jump: Navigate to predicted cursor positions

Tab to Import: Automatically import dependencies

Latest Wave 3 Updates (2025)
New Features:

Model Context Protocol (MCP): Connect Cascade to third-party tools

Turbo Mode: Automate terminal commands without approval

Drag & Drop Images: Simplify workflows by dropping images directly

Credit Visibility: Track credit usage per tool call

Custom App Icons: Personalize your experience (Mac only)

Best Practices & Workflow Optimization
1. Strategic AI Usage
Focus on High-Value Tasks:

Use Cascade for complex multi-file refactoring operations

Reserve premium models for architectural decisions and comprehensive analysis

Leverage free models (Cascade Base, DeepSeek V3, DeepSeek R1) for routine tasks

Efficient Prompting:

Break complex features into discrete, manageable tasks

Provide clear, specific instructions to minimize AI errors

Use natural language commands for inline editing with Cmd/Ctrl+I

2. Memory Management System
Cascade Memories:

Auto-generated memories persist context across conversations

Manually create memories with "create a memory of..." prompts

Memories are workspace-specific and retrieved when relevant

Best Practice Implementation:

text
# Memory Bank Structure
memory-bank/
├── activeContext.md      # Session state and goals
├── productContext.md     # Project scope and architecture
├── progress.md          # Work status and milestones
└── decisionLog.md       # Important decisions record
3. Rules Configuration
Global Rules: Apply across all workspaces for consistent behavior
Workspace Rules: Project-specific rules for targeted assistance

Example Rules Setup:

Language preferences and coding standards

Framework-specific requirements (Next.js version, etc.)

API usage patterns and conventions

4. Workspace Organization
File Structure Best Practices:

Use split view for multi-file editing

Organize projects clearly to leverage contextual awareness

Maintain focused conversations in separate chat threads

Documentation Strategy:

Build comprehensive markdown documentation

Use Mermaid diagrams for system visualization

Maintain step-by-step tutorials and use cases

Advanced Features
1. Terminal Integration
Command Generation:

Use Cmd/Ctrl+I in terminal for natural language command generation

Send terminal selections to Cascade with Cmd/Ctrl+L

Automated Execution:

Configure allow/deny lists for auto-execution

Enable Turbo Mode for autonomous command execution

Set up Auto mode for AI-judged command approval

2. Web Search Integration
Cascade can search the web for information to reference in suggestions. This feature helps with:

Finding up-to-date documentation

Researching best practices

Gathering external context for complex problems

3. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
New in Wave 3: Connect Cascade to third-party tools through standardized MCP servers:

Configure MCP servers through JSON in Windsurf settings

Access external data sources seamlessly

Enhance AI capabilities with custom tools

4. Windsurf Previews
