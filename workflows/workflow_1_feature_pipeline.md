# Workflow 1: Feature Planner-Executor-Verifier Pipeline

## Purpose
Automated feature implementation using a planning agent, coding executor, and verifier.

## Agent Roles
- **Planner**: Decomposes feature request into tasks.
- **Executor**: Writes code based on the plan.
- **Verifier**: Runs tests and verifies quality.

## Tech Stack
- Agno for agent orchestration
- FastAPI for exposing `/implement_feature`
- Pydantic for plan/schema validation
- Windsurf for workspace context, editing, and rule injection
- Optional: Vector DB for domain-specific retrieval

## Deployment
- Local: Windsurf IDE or CLI tool
- Cloud: FastAPI app with containerized agent services

## Use Cases
- Auto-implement user stories
- Auto-generate feature branches
- Close bug reports with verified fixes
